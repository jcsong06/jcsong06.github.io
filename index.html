      <p>
        I'm a computer science PhD candidate at Stanford University studying artificial intelligence.
        I completed a master's in CS from Stanford and received the Christopher Stephenson Memorial
        Award for the best CS master's thesis. My current research is on back-and-forth validation
        of critical autonomy systems, focusing on reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization, and
        robust methods for controlling uncertain systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently a grad research assistant at the 
        <a href="https://sisl.stanford.edu">Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory (SISL)</a>
        advised by Mykel Kochenderfer and a part of the 
        <a href="https://scerf.stanford.edu">Stanford Center for AI Safety</a> 
        and the Stanford School of Sustainability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I was a research staff member at MIT Lincoln Laboratory and was part of the
        team that developed, optimized, and validated the next-generation aircraft collision
        avoidance systems, certified by the FAA.

        <strong>And I love Julia.</strong>
