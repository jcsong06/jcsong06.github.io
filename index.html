      <p>
        I'm a computer science undergraduate student at Stanford University studying AI, robotics, and graphics.
        I have completed two years of undergraduate CS classes at the University of Minnesota in high school.
        My current interests are in AI, computer vision, autonomous control systems, and reinforcement learning. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently a grad research assistant at the 
        <a href="https://sisl.stanford.edu">Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory (SISL)</a>
        advised by Mykel Kochenderfer and a part of the 
        <a href="https://scerf.stanford.edu">Stanford Center for AI Safety</a> 
        and the Stanford School of Sustainability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I was a research staff member at MIT Lincoln Laboratory and was part of the
        team that developed, optimized, and validated the next-generation aircraft collision
        avoidance systems, certified by the FAA.

      <p>
        <strong>And I love Julia.</strong>
